# frontend-agent Instructions

This directory contains the Next.js interface managed by the **frontend-agent**.

## Responsibilities
- Build pages for login, inventory dashboard and item management.
- Use components from V0.dev or simple React components.
- Integrate with the backend API defined by the backend-agent.

## Development notes
- Install dependencies with `npm install`.
- Start the development server using `npm run dev`.
- The API base URL defaults to `http://localhost:8000` but can be overridden via `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`.
- Keep components simple and avoid heavy UI frameworks.
