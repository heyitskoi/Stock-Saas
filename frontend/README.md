# Frontend Quickstart

Install dependencies and start the Next.js app:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Run the Playwright tests (browsers will be installed automatically):

```bash
npm run test
```

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` if your API is running on a different URL than `http://localhost:8000`.
