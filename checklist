1. Security & Authentication
Expectation	Why it Matters
✅ Authenticated access (JWT) - implemented
✅ Role-based permissions - implemented
🔒 Secure API endpoints	HTTPS, no anonymous access to protected data
🔐 Password management	Hashing, reset tokens, possibly 2FA for admin accounts

2. Multi-Tenancy Support
Expectation	Why it Matters
✅ Company/Department isolation	Each tenant should only access their own data
✅ Scoped APIs and DB queries	Every query respects company_id or similar
✅ Admin/Manager per tenant	Each tenant manages its own users and policies

3. Database & Persistence
Expectation	Why it Matters
✅ Use a real database (PostgreSQL, SQLite for dev)	JSON is fine for testing but not scalable
✅ Data migrations (Alembic)	Safely evolve schema over time
✅ Relational models	Items, users, departments, logs, etc. with foreign keys

4. Logging, Auditing & History
Expectation	Why it Matters
✅ Audit log of changes	Trace who did what and when (add, issue, delete)
✅ System logs (e.g., with structlog)	Useful for debugging, monitoring, compliance
✅ Item history (who used it, when)	Helps with asset tracking and accountability

5. Notifications & Alerts
Expectation	Why it Matters
✅ Email/Slack alerts for low stock	Proactive restocking decisions
✅ Scheduled summary reports	Daily/weekly insights for managers
✅ Webhooks for integrations	Plug into other systems (e.g., procurement)

6. UX Expectations
Expectation	Why it Matters
✅ Responsive, clean UI	Users expect a polished experience (V0.dev helps here)
✅ FastAPI + OpenAPI Docs	Auto-generated, interactive API docs
✅ Error handling and feedback	Users know what went wrong and why

7. Scalability and Deployment
Expectation	Why it Matters
✅ Dockerized deployment	Makes local/dev/staging/prod setups consistent
✅ CI/CD integration (e.g., GitHub Actions)	Automates tests and deploys safely
✅ Environment config management	.env or secret manager usage for clean separation of dev/staging/prod

8. Extensibility
Expectation	Why it Matters
✅ Plugin/hooks or config system	Different orgs might want custom fields or flows
✅ Modular service classes	Logic isn’t hardcoded — easy to override or extend
✅ CLI + API + GUI	Reuse core logic from anywhere (perfect for internal)
Optional/Nice-to-Haves)
To cover even more edge cases or future growth, you could optionally expand with:

✅ 9. Compliance & Data Protection (if going enterprise)
Expectation	Why it Matters
GDPR/Data export tools	Users should be able to export/delete data if required
Data encryption at rest	Required for sensitive environments
Regular backups / restores	Protection from data loss

✅ 10. Mobile or Offline Access (for warehouse use)
Expectation	Why it Matters
PWA/mobile-friendly views	Store rooms often use tablets/phones
Offline queuing	Let actions queue locally when internet is down (sync later)

✅ 11. Performance & Load Handling
Expectation	Why it Matters
Query/index optimization	As item volume grows
Background jobs (e.g., Celery)	For large reports, reminders, webhooks
✅ Rate limiting	To avoid abuse or overloading APIs
