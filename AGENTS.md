# AGENTS.md

This project uses a multi-agent approach to build a SaaS inventory platform.

## Agents

### 1. 📦 `backend-agent`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - FastAPI project structure
  - Inventory endpoints (add, issue, return, status)
  - User authentication & roles (admin, manager, user)
  - Storage layer (initially JSON, later switch to PostgreSQL)
  - Business logic (stock thresholds, audit logging)
- **Key files**: `main.py`, `routers/`, `models/`, `schemas/`

### 2. 🖥️ `frontend-agent`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - React/Next.js app using V0.dev components
  - Pages for login, inventory dashboard, issue/return forms
  - Status warning indicators when stock is low
  - API integration with backend endpoints

### 3. 📊 `analytics-agent`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Tracks item usage trends
  - Exports reports (CSV, printable summaries)
  - Displays usage dashboards per item/user

### 4. 🧪 `test-agent`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Unit tests for backend services
  - API integration tests
  - Frontend behavior validation (basic test coverage)

### 5. ⚙️ `ops-agent`
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Docker builds and Compose orchestration
  - Manage Nginx configuration
  - Provide helper scripts for local development

## Project Scope

- Multi-tenant inventory system (each department manages its own stock)
- Role-based access control
- Simple CLI evolved into full-stack web app

### 🚀 Instructions for Codex
- Follow this document to decide where to place new features
- Use `backend-agent` as the default agent for core logic unless specified


## Agent Collaboration

- `frontend-agent` consumes APIs from `backend-agent`.
- `analytics-agent` relies on `backend-agent` for historical data endpoints.
- `test-agent` should validate all routes exposed by `backend-agent`, and simulate user flows generated by `frontend-agent`.

## Agent Status

| Agent          | Status   | Notes                             |
